Max-SAT Evaluation
=========

Intro
-------

Hello, I am currently a master's degree student working mostly with meta-learning and optimization.

I might be working with MaxSAT problem between my usual readings, and any implementations will be uploaded in this repository.

Building
---------------
Just run
`$ makepp`
The Makefile is useful only for makepp and not for gnu make.
